Notes
=====



- Matevz, Ulno, Fedir (welcome new team member!), Renato

- Pick up computers at Aticomp on Friday 24

- Matevz suggests using Snipe-IT + lable machine, ulno and Matevz are still evaluating

- Fedir stresses github importance, Matevz and Fedir want to make list of pointers

- Discord, prep new things, add Fedir to instructors - Renato/Ulno - drive engagement on discord

- Ulno/Renato used VSCode for shared class devolopent in this git repo

- Ulno/Renato: "If we cannot decide use K.I.S.S. - keep it as simple as possible" 

- All teaching stuff on git

- Matevz integrates discord

- Grow IoTempower community!

- Strengthen portfolio idea on git - TODO: add and polish sample portfolio (German and English version? @Ruben)

- Tasks vs Contracts? Need to be simpler and easier to understand - add more personal agency to bind specific 
  tasks to students, how to add projects earlier?

- What about project portfolio? (given early)

- Demo showcase on day one, Masterclass 

- Demo showcase
    - Demobox

- more 3d printing
  - USB power box

- breadboarding individually!
